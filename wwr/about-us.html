                    Rafting is a white water sports activity that has grown in popularity, especially in Central Europe, since the 80s. While in the beginning, rafts were made of wood, the boats used today come in the form of a rubber dinghy and are used to traverse along white water rivers and other bodies of water. Depending on the course of the river, white water rapids of varying degrees of difficulty are mastered along the way. Rafts are made of several layers of robust rubber to allow them to come into contact with stones and rocks without breaking. The size of the boats varies between 3 and 6 m, and, dependent on their length, they are suited for different group sizes. Typically, boats can hold between 2 and 20 people.

                    River Rafting is a competitive sport in which the objective is to navigate downstream on river rapids using an inflated raft. It is considered an extreme sport that is highly challenging and risky, and requires a great deal of teamwork. Rafting is also an extremely popular recreational activity practiced in most countries around the world.
